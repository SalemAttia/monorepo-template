    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Get full history so Nx can detect what changed
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      # Step 2: Install Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use Node.js version 20

      # Step 4: Install all dependencies

        run: pnpm run affected:lint
        
      # Step 6: Test only what changed
      - name: Test affected projects  
        run: pnpm run affected:test --parallel=3

      # Step 7: Build only what changed
      - name: Build affected projects
        run: pnpm run affected:build --parallel=3
